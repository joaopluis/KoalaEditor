# Koala Editor

**Koala Editor** is an awesome jQuery WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) HTML editor.

It is easy to integrate into your existing projects and has a simple flat design. As a bonus, it has a cute koala as a mascot.

## Features

* 100% Mobile Responsive
* Functional, Flat Design Style
* Fully extendable
* Some more I have to think to list here

## Download

You can download **Koala** using Bower:

```
bower install koala
```

This will install Koala and its dependencies.

Alternativelly, you can download Koala's latest release from its GitHub page.

### Dependencies

**Koala** depends on jQuery, jQuery UI Resizable behaviour and Font Awesome.

## Setting up Koala

To use Koala, you must include in the page:

* jQuery
* jQuery UI (JS and CSS)
* Font Awesome
* Koala (JS and CSS)

With these included, just call `koala()` on the jQuery element you want to turn into an editor.

## What can I do with Koala?

With Koala, everyone can create HTML.

*(Note that Koala isn't designed to create whole websites, but HTML sections to be included on a page.)*

Straight out of the box, Koala allows you to set a few options, but you can customize Koala further than that. Koala allows you to create your own themes, commands and buttons. The full documentation (still to be completed) lists all the classes, methods and events of Koala, along with some small tutorials, to help you get started setting up your own Koala.
